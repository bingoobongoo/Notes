A **data structure** is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively. They are essential ingriedients in creating fast and powerful [[Algorithms|algorithms]]. They help to manage and organize data, and also make code cleaner and easier to understand. 

## Abstract Data Type

An **abstract data type** is an abstraction of a data structure which provide only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what [[Programming Languages|programming language]]. 

## Complexity Analysis

When it comes to data structures, there are 2 crucial factors we need to be aware of:
1. How much **time** does this algorithm need to finish?
2. How much **space** does this algorithm need for its computation?

The answer for this question is something called [[Big-O Notation]].

## Types of data structures:

1. [[Arrays|Array]]
2. [[Linked Lists]]
3. [[Stack]]
4. [[Queue]]
5. [[Priority Queue]]
6. [[Union Find]]

> Rember to make sure that when implementing any data structures, your program doesn't has any memory leaks.
